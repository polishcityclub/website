### Guest speaker series

In order to broaden network, knowledge and professional aspirations of our members we organise evening gatherings to which we invite interesting, Polish or international speakers from area of politics, academia or business. An hour or so the presentation of our guest is usually followed by a Q&A session, drinks and networking opportunity. Those who expressed their interest before the event may then accompany the guest at a dinner.

### BTMB – Beat the Monday Blues

### Aspire

Aspire Programme is our intellectual aspiration to activate and unlock the potential of Polish Diaspora in the UK and motivate Poles to actively participate in local communities and have a say in local, national and EU elections.
By Aspire Programme we develop, implement and support Marketing and Education Programmes to the Polish Diaspora residing outside Poland, that will create greater access to the political life participation and other opportunities including Local/Central/EU/Polish elections in the United Kingdom and further ‘exporting’ this idea to Continental Europe.
