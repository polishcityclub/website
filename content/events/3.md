Our next PCC event will take place on 4th March at Eight Club Moorgate. We have the pleasure of speaking to Henry Balani about why the Blockchain matters – and why it is different from Bitcoin. His presentation examines the fundamentals of the Blockchain – what it is, why it is useful, and how it is different from Bitcoin. By now nearly everyone has heard of crypto-currencies. While crypto currencies are in the headlines for their volatile value, the technology underlying it is being used by major firms from IBM to JPMorgan across the economy. That technology is called Blockchain and is useful for securely recording, moving, and storing financial value of all types.  Come learn why this technology is rapidly being adopted by the industry and the impact it will have on economy and society.
