Tickets at [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/polish-city-club-speaker-event-tomasz-czechowicz-mci-tickets-51414399854)

We are looking forward to seeing you at 7pm at the Eight Club Moorgate. Remember to sign up here, as tickets are already flying off the shelves. 

Tomasz has been a speaker at the Club a couple of times, yet over the last years he has been especially busy, making his first unicorn investment (Gett), leading rounds for European fintech leaders like iZettle and Azimo or successfully exiting companies with beautiful returns for his investors (Dotpay/eCard sold for PLN 315m vs. PLN 60m invested), not to mention completing countless marathons and triathlons.

Drinks and snacks included.
