Experiences gathered during expeditions, from conquering the North and South Poles without external assistance, conquering both Earth poles in one year with 15-year-old disabled Jan Mela, to No Trace Expedition by electric car through the Gobi desert and Siberia, provide a great inspiration to look for solutions to pandemic crisis and motivation for everyday life.
 
 Indeed, the expeditions are - during the lecture - a reason to talk about the acceptance of situations that are beyond our direct influence, about the process of adapting our mind to change, and about dealing with uncertainty and fear, which in the context of current events related to coronavirus, gains in importance and becomes very topical.
